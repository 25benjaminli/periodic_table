Hi.

This is a calculator I whipped up that helps especially with molar mass calculations.

Saved me a lotta time in that stoichiometry worksheet, hopefully it helps you out too.

Follow the instructions it gives.

*IMPORTANT* the calculator can only interpret single elements at a time, and the continuous sum is tracked via "sum"

E.g. 

NaOH -> Type in Na, then O, then H

Typing the above in directly would *NOT* work since the calculator would not know how to identify each element/compound.


Example of *valid inputs* for elements:

Mg3
O <-- Assumes a single atom

Examples of *invalid inputs* for elements (it will tell you that it cannot make the calculation):

MMMM <-- doesn't exist
NA3 <-- elements are case sensitive (as they appear on periodic table)
NaO2 <--
