Hi.

This software will be able to handle multiple periodic table related things in the future, but as of now, it helps with molar mass calculations.

**What this calculator does **
As stated above, this calculator helps with calculating molar mass of big compounds. Personally, I have found it very tedious to have to look up the atomic mass of each element, then multiply it by the # of occurrences, then repeat the process for every element within the compound. Therefore, this calculator's molar mass functionality allows you to simply type in the element's name (e.g. Na), followed directly by the number of times you want it (e.g. Na3). You can also choose to omit a number, and it will default to one (e.g. Na = one sodium atom).

**IMPORTANT**: the calculator can only interpret single elements at a time, and the continuous sum is tracked via "sum"

E.g. 

NaOH -> Type in Na, then O, then H

Typing the above in directly would *NOT* work since the calculator would not know how to identify each element/compound.


Example of **valid inputs** for elements:

Mg3
O <-- Assumes a single atom

Examples of **invalid inputs** for elements (it will tell you that it cannot make the calculation):

MMMM <-- doesn't exist
NA3 <-- elements are case sensitive (as they appear on periodic table)
NaO2 <-- cannot have multiple elements grouped together (must be entered separately)

P.S. Yes, I hardcoded the entire periodic table and may have sustained heavy brain damage, but it was worth it.
